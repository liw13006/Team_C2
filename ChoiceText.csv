This is a consent form for research participation. It contains important information about this study and what to expect if you decide to participate. 



Your participation is voluntary. 

You are invited to participate in this unfunded dissertation research study as you are a Registered Behavior Technician™ (RBT®), Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® (BCaBA®), Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®), or Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral™ (BCBA-D™) via The Behavior Analyst Certification Board®, Inc. (BACB®) working within the United States and Puerto Rico. Please consider the following information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether or not to participate.



 

Purpose:

The purpose of this study is to investigate the practices, knowledge, and attitudes of ABA clinicians regarding the use of animals as an adjunct to ABA services. In addition to inquiring about the frequency of use and logistical aspects of animal use, this survey will also examine clinicians’ understandings of the research and ethical considerations, as well as the desirability and perceived feasibility of animal-assisted interventions as an adjunct to ABA services.  



 

Procedures:

You will be asked to complete one web-based survey that will collect non-specific demographic information, if/how you incorporate animals into ABA services, your knowledge and awareness of animal-assisted interventions, attitudinal measures regarding animals, and your thoughts about intervention desirability and feasibility.



 

Duration:

Survey duration is dependent on the amount of experience you have with the intervention of focus. For the majority of participants, participation should be approximately 10-15 minutes, but for those that have more information to share, survey duration could be 15-20 minutes. You may leave the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the study, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your decision will not affect your future relationship with Boston University.



 

Risks and Benefits:

There are minimal risks associated with this survey study. If you feel emotional, upset, or uncomfortable when answering some of the questions, you may choose not to answer. You may take a break or stop the survey at any point. While there are no immediate benefits to you from taking part in this research, others may benefit in the future from the information that is learned in this study.



 

Confidentiality:

We will work to make sure that on one sees your online responses without approval. But, because we are using the Internet, there is a chance that someone could access your online responses without permission. We will protect your privacy by labeling your anonymous survey with a code and study data will be stored on the password-protected Boston University Google Drive. While the results of this research study may be published, no identifiable information will be included in such manuscript.

Incentives:

No incentives will be provided for participation.
